### Secure Server/Client Framework

Reactor is a framework designed to enable the development of server and client applications that rely on reliability, performance and security.

Reactor can also be used for IPC.

**Attention:** Reactor is a framework that is at a very early stage of development. In the Development Roadmap you can find out more about future and planned features.

The latest implementation allows TCP Server/Clients to be developed using the JSON Mime Format. For example, a Python script can be used as a client while Reactor runs as a .net server on the other side.

Check out the SimpleJsonServer/Client Projects in the Example folder.

Important to note are the specifications for packet exchange and encoding, since UFT-16 Little Endian is transmitted in the encoding.

Reactor is used for Eos: https://github.com/sojournercntl/Eos
